    --> IN CAESAR CIPHER WE ENCRYPT USING KEY BY SHIFTING THE ALPHABETIC PATTERN ACCORDING THE KEY.
    --> FOR EXAMPLE:
    A B C D E F G H I J K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z
    | | | | | | | | | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

    KEY = 4

    PLAIN TEXT :--> QUIENTEN DID A MAGIC TRICK
    CIPHER TEXT :--> UYMIRXIRDHMHDEDQEKMGDXVMGO

    ACCORDING TO THE KEY THE PLAIN TEXT IS CONVERTED IS CONVERTED INTO CIPHER TEXT

    IT IS A TYPE OF SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
    THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE OF THE SYMMETRIC ALGORITHM IS THE EXCHANGE OF KEY FOR ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION BETWEEN SENDER AND RECEIVER

    THE FUNCTION TO CONVERT THE PLAIN TEXT TO CIPHER TEXT IS:
    CIPHER TEXT=(X+KEY) MOD 26

    THE FUNCTION TO CONVERT THE CIPHER TEXT TO PLAIN TEXT IS:
    PLAIN TEXT=(X-KEY) MOD 26

    HERE, 26 IS THE RANGE OF ALPHABET WE ARE USING IN THE EXAMPLE BUT WE CAN USE ASCII VALUES AS RANGE FOR BIGGER APPLICATIONS
    X IS THE INDEX OF THE ELEMENT KEY IS THE NUMBER TO BE SHIFTED
    WE HAVE USED MOD TO REPEAT THE RANGE CYCLE THAT IS THE LOOP DOES NOT GOES OUTSIDE THE RANGE
