    --> IN CAESAR CIPHER WE ENCRYPT USING KEY BY SHIFTING THE ALPHABETIC PATTERN ACCORDING THE KEY.
    --> FOR EXAMPLE:
    A B C D E F G H I J K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z
    | | | | | | | | | | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

    KEY = 4

    PLAIN TEXT :--> QUIENTEN DID A MAGIC TRICK
    CIPHER TEXT :--> UYMIRXIRDHMHDEDQEKMGDXVMGO

    ACCORDING TO THE KEY THE PLAIN TEXT IS CONVERTED IS CONVERTED INTO CIPHER TEXT

    IT IS A TYPE OF SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
    THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE OF THE SYMMETRIC ALGORITHM IS THE EXCHANGE OF KEY FOR ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION BETWEEN SENDER AND RECEIVER
